# AeroGameFramework
A powerful game framework for the Roblox platform.

AeroGameFramework is a Roblox game framework that makes development easy and fun. The framework is designed to simplify the communication between modules and seamlessly bridge the gap between the server and client. Never again will you have to touch RemoteFunctions or RemoteEvents.

# Video Tutorial
Learn how to use the framework in the video tutorial series:

# Install & Update
Run the installer from the [AeroGameFramework plugin](https://www.roblox.com/library/1882232354/AeroGameFramework-Plugin). The installer will allow you to install and update the framework.

# Structure
AeroGameFramework is structured into three categories: Server, Client, and Shared.

- `[Server] ServerStorage.Aero.Services`
- `[Server] ServerStorage.Aero.Modules`
- `[Client] StarterPlayerScripts.Aero.Controllers`
- `[Client] StarterPlayerScripts.Aero.Modules`
- `[Shared] ReplicatedStorage.Aero.Shared`

## Server
`ServerStorage.Aero.Services` & `ServerStorage.Aero.Modules`

#### Services
Services are modules that are initialized and run at runtime. All services are exposed to each other. Services can also expose functions and events to the client.

#### Modules
Modules are lazy-loaded modules that services can access as needed.

## Client
`StarterPlayerScripts.Aero.Controllers` & `StarterPlayerScripts.Aero.Modules`

#### Controllers
Client controllers work similarly to server-side services, whereas all the modules are initialized and started at runtime and all modules are exposed to each other. Services that expose client-side methods and events can be accessed with these controller modules.

#### Modules
Client-side modules have the exact functionality as server-side modules, except that they are run on the client.

## Shared
`ReplicatedStorage.Aero.Shared`

Shared modules are modules that can be used by both the client and the server.

# API
Documentation of how to use server services and client modules.

## API - Server Service
```lua
local MyService = {Client = {}}

function MyService:Start()
  -- Called when all services have been initialized
end

function MyService:Init()
  -- Called when the module is first loaded.
  -- Safe to reference 'self.Services/Modules/Shared'
  -- NOT safe to USE/INVOKE other services yet (use them in/after Start method)
end

return MyService
```
#### Injected Properties:
- `service.Services` Table of all other services, referenced by the name of the ModuleScript
- `service.Modules` Table of all objects, referenced by the name of the ModuleScript
- `service.Shared` Table of all shared modules, referenced by the name of the ModuleScript
- `service.Client.Server` References back to the service, so client-facing methods can invoke server-facing methods
#### Injected Methods:
- `Void        service:RegisterEvent(String eventName)`
- `Void        service:RegisterClientEvent(String eventName)`
- `Void        service:FireEvent(String eventName, ...)`
- `Void        service:FireClientEvent(String eventName, Instance player, ...)`
- `Void        service:FireAllClientsEvent(String eventName, ...)`
- `Connection  service:ConnectEvent(String eventName, Function handler)`
- `Connection  service:ConnectClientEvent(String eventName, Function handler)`

## API - Client Controller
```lua
local MyController = {}

function MyController:Start()
  -- Called when all controllers have been initialized
end

function MyController:Init()
  -- Called when the controller is first loaded.
  -- Safe to reference 'self.Controllers/Modules/Objects/Shared'
  -- NOT safe to USE/INVOKE other controllers yet (use them in/after Start method)
end

return MyController
```
#### Injected Properties:
- `controller.Controllers` Table of all other controllers, referenced by the name of the ModuleScript
- `controller.Modules` Table of all modules, referenced by the name of the ModuleScript
- `controller.Shared` Table of all shared modules, referenced by the name of the ModuleScript
- `controller.Services` Table of all server-side services, referenced by the name of the ModuleScript
- `controller.Player` Reference to the LocalPlayer (i.e. `game.Players.LocalPlayer`)

#### Injected Methods:
- `Void        controller:RegisterEvent(String eventName)`
- `Void        controller:FireEvent(String eventName, ...)`
- `Connection  controller:ConnectEvent(String eventName, Function handler)`

# Basic Examples - Server

## Server Service
Here is a basic service:

```lua
local TestService = {}

function TestService:Add(a, b)
  return a + b
end

function TestService:Start()
  -- Ran after all services have been initialized
end

function TestService:Init()
  -- Do anything to set up the service.
  -- It is NOT safe to run code from other services, but they CAN be referenced.
end

return TestService
```

## Service-to-service Communication
Here is an example of a service invoking the method of another service. Note that `self.Services` exposes all the services:

```lua
local AnotherService = {}

local testService

function AnotherService:Start()
  -- Invoke the TestService:
  local sum = testService:Add(5, 3)
  print("5 + 3 = ", sum)
end

function AnotherService:Init()
  -- Reference the TestService:
  testService = self.Services.TestService
end

return AnotherService
```

## Service Events
Here is an example of a service registering, firing, and connecting to an event:

```lua
local MyService = {}

function MyService:Start()

  -- Connect to the event:
  self:ConnectEvent("Hello", function(msg)
    print(msg)
  end)

end

function MyService:Init()

  -- Register the event:
  self:RegisterEvent("Hello")

  -- Fire the event after 5 seconds:
  delay(5, function()
    self:FireEvent("Hello", "How are you?")
  end)

end

return MyService
```

## Service exposing method and event to client
Here's an example where a service exposes a method and event to the client:
```lua
local MyService = {Client={}} -- Notice the 'Client={}'

-- Client-exposed method:
function MyService.Client:Hello(player, ...)
  print(player.Name .. " says hello")
  return "Hello to you too!"
end

function MyService:Start()

  -- Fire client event after 5 seconds:
  delay(5, function()
    self:FireAllClientsEvent("HelloClient", "Hello!")
  end)

  -- Fire client event to individual player:
  delay(5, function()
    self:FireClientEvent("HelloClient", game.Players.SomePlayer, "Hi!")
  end)

end

function MyService:Init()

  -- Expose client event:
  self:RegisterClientEvent("HelloClient")

  -- Connecting to client event:
  self:ConnectClientEvent("HelloClient", function(player, ...)
    -- Foo
  end)

end

return MyService
```

## Service client method invoking server method
Sometimes your client-facing methods need to invoke your server-facing methods. Reference the `self.Server` field to do this:
```lua
local MyService = {Client = {}}

function MyService:DoSomethingServerSide()
  return math.random()
end

-- Client-facing method:
function MyService.Client:GetRandom()
  -- Invoke server-facing method:
  local number = self.Server:DoSomethingServerSide()
  return number
end

function MyService:Start() end
function MyService:Init() end

return MyService
```

# Basic Examples - Client

## Client Controller
Here is a basic client controller that also connects to a server-side service:

```lua
local SomeController = {}

function SomeController:Test(x)
  print("Test!")
  return x * 2
end

function SomeController:Start()

  -- Connect to server event:
  self.Services.MyService.HelloClient:Connect(function(msg)
    print(msg)
    -- Fire event back to server:
    self.Services.MyService.HelloClient:Fire("Hello to you too!")
  end)
  
  -- Fire server method:
  local msg = self.Services.MyService:Hello("Hi there")
  print(msg)
  
end

function SomeController:Init()
  -- Run code here to set up the controller.
  -- Similar to services, it is NOT safe to invoke other controllers in this method, but you CAN reference them.
end

return SomeController
```

## Client controller invoking another controller
Here is an example of a client controller invoking another client controller:

```lua
local MyController = {}

local someController

function MyController:Start()
  -- Invoke the other controller:
  local result = someController:Test(32)
  print(result)
end

function MyController:Init()
  -- Reference the other controller:
  someController = self.Controllers.SomeController
end

return MyController
```

# Global
In certain circumstances, you may want to access the framework from code executing independent from the framework. In order to do this, both the client and the server root tables have been exposed on the global scope. Because they are not exposed until fully loaded, you will have to wait for them to exist by using a `while` or `repeat` loop, as shown in the examples below.

### Server Global Example
```lua
while (not _G.AeroServer) do wait() end
local aeroServer = _G.AeroServer

aeroServer.Services.SomeService:DoSomething()
```

### Client Global Example
```lua
while (not _G.Aero) do wait() end
local aero = _G.Aero

aero.Controllers.Fade:In()
aero.Services.TestService:Hello()
```

# Internal
AeroGameFramework is run by two scripts, `AeroServer` and `AeroClient`. The `AeroServer` script is located under `ServerScriptService.Aero`, and the `AeroClient` script is located under `StarterPlayerScripts.Aero`. These two scripts take care of executing the modules within the game framework. For the sake of stability, it is recommended that these scripts remain unaltered.

When looking at in-game statistics, such as memory usage, it is important to note that all modules created within the framework will be listed under either of these two scripts.

## Init & Start Methods
For both server-side services and client-side controllers, the `Init` methods are executed one-by-one on the _same_ thread. Each `Init` method must finish before the next one is called. Once every single `Init` is finished, the framework will then call each `Start` method on _different_ threads. Therefore, it is not wise to yield within any `Init` method, but doing so in the `Start` methods will be fine.
